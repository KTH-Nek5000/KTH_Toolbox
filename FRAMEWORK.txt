@brief Toolbox for Nek5000

@details 
This directory contains a number of tools used by toolboxes developed at KTH. 
Files are grouped by taks and placed in a tree structure, where the parent directories (modules) 
perform some operations and can define tasks and interfaces that have to be provided by their 
subdirectories (submodules). This structure can be repeated recursively with submodules becoming
parent modules for nex level structures. The top level directories are related to the main services 
that have to be provided for toolboxes. An examplary framework structure is presented in a figure.

Modules can provide tools, [runtime parameters] (@ref parameter_list_page), memory structures (common blocks), 
define interfaces and perform some tasks.
The main goal is to simplify the development of toolboxes by defining simple tasks that could be used by a number of tools. 
At the same time, a clear definition of the inteface alows to keep number of different implementation of the same task.

Each module has to contain:
- FRAMEWORK.txt -module description
- makefile_usr.inc - compilation rules
- source code
- optionally, an example of \a setup.par including corresponding runtime parameter section

Dependences between modules are described in FRAMEWORK.txt (present in almost every directory) including:
- documentation section written in a form of doxygen C comment
  + definition of group
  + description of the module's purpose
  + definition of the interface provided by the module
  + list of required interfaces from submodules (module dependency)
  + example of a module call
  + list of provided runtime parameters
  + list of requred runtime parameters (module dependency)
  + example of a section in \a setup.par file
- SUBMODULES - list of existing local submodules (different task implementations)
- EXCLUSIVE - list of local submodules that cannot be used simultaneously
- DEFAULT - default submodules
- CONFLICTS - list of modules in conflict with current module (from other tree branches)
- REQUIRED - list of required modules (from other tree branches)
- OBJECT - list of object files for the USR variable in makenek
- INCLUDE - list of include files
